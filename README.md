# Snake-Water-Gun-Game

Snake Water Gun Game 🐍💧🔫
This is a simple Python-based Snake Water Gun game, similar to Rock Paper Scissors. Players can choose between Snake, Water, or Gun, and the game decides the winner based on the rules.

Features
Interactive gameplay with user input.
Randomized computer choices for fair play.
Current Progress
I am currently working on adding graphics to make the game more engaging and visually appealing.

Feel free to check it out and contribute ideas for improvements! 🚀
